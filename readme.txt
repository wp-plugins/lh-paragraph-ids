LH Paragraph Ids is a WordPress plugin that adds paragraph level ids elements to singular posts and post types.

== Description ==

LH Paragraph Level IDs plugin adds an ‘id’ attribute to each paragraph tag in a blog post, giving the author and readers additional functionality.

So for example, <p> becomes <p id="para1234-5">.

There is also an optional feature to add a link to the paragraph at the end of the post, like this. #

These additions allow anyone to link directly to that paragraph in the post. This is useful for long tracts of text and is also useful for rdf and semantics (in that these technologies often require identification of parts of a page).
